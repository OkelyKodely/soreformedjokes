5. There once was a Korean who met a japanese soldier and the two of them
became closest friends.  They always prayed and ate together every meal.   To them

say this about every genuine believer in Christ.  Then came the storm.  It was rapture day.

Witnessing About Our King
A {Poem by Daniel Cho

See him in mall, once upon the fall.
Trusting in the fame, hallowed be thy name.
See him resolute, walking with his foot, in his boot.
Praying ceaselessly, as if aimlessly.
Trying rights and songs, eating without cone.
It’s an ice cream, there’s his offering.

See him in despair, thinking what is fair.
Surrounded by his walls, many many calls.
Ruining the “mean”, ever wallowing.
Seeking what is goot, thank you for this fut.

Trusting and running for the prize,
Ever fix-ed eyes,
Grace, and grace, and grace,
Living for the race.

Despondent finally,
Searching aimlessly,
Knowing right from wrong,
Could I be, “wrong”?

See him in lament, now should he repent?
Not yet, not yet, and, publishing his thoughts,
What else have I wrought?

Except to live to his fame,
Hallowed be Your Name.

Game.
